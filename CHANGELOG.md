# PowerShell Editor Services Release History

## 0.7.0
### Thursday, August 18, 2016

#### Introducing support for Linux and macOS!

This release marks the beginning of our support for Linux and macOS via
the new [cross-platform release of PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

NuGet packages will be provided in the upcoming 0.7.1 release.

#### Other improvements

- Introduced a new TCP channel to provide a commonly-available communication channel
  across multiple editors and platforms
- PowerShell Script Analyzer integration has been shifted from direct use via DLL to
  consuming the PowerShell module and cmdlets
- Updated code to account for platform differences across Windows and Linux/macOS
- Improved stability of the language service when being used in Sublime Text

## 0.6.2
### Tuesday, August 9, 2016

- Fixed #264: Variable and parameter IntelliSense broken in VS Code 1.4.0
- Fixed #240: Completion item with regex metachars can cause editor host to crash
- Fixed #232: Language server sometimes crashes then $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

## 0.6.1
### Monday, May 16, 2016

- Fixed #221: Language server sometimes fails to initialize preventing IntelliSense, etc from working
- Fixed #222: Editor commands are not receiving $host.UI prompt results

## 0.6.0
### Thursday, May 12, 2016

#### Introduced a new documentation site

- We have launched a new [documentation site](https://powershell.github.io/PowerShellEditorServices/)
  for this project on GitHub Pages.  This documentation provides both a user guide
  and .NET API documentation pages that are generated directly from our code
  documentation.  Check it out and let us know what you think!

#### Added a new cross-editor extensibility model

- We've added a new extensibility model which allows you to write PowerShell
  code to add new functionality to Visual Studio Code and other editors with
  a single API.  If you've used `$psISE` in the PowerShell ISE, you'll feel
  right at home with `$psEditor`.  Check out the [documentation](https://powershell.github.io/PowerShellEditorServices/guide/extensions.html)
  for more details!

#### Support for user and system-wide profiles

- We've now introduced the `$profile` variable which contains the expected
  properties that you normally see in `powershell.exe` and `powershell_ise.exe`:
  - `AllUsersAllHosts`
  - `AllUsersCurrentHost`
  - `CurrentUserAllHosts`
  - `CurrentUserCurrentHost`
- Each editor integration can specify what their host-specific profile filename
  should be.  If no profile name has been specified a default of `PowerShellEditorServices_profile.ps1`
  is used.
- Profiles are not loaded by default when PowerShell Editor Services is used.
  This behavior may change in the future based on user feedback.
- Editor integrations can also specify their name and version for the `$host.Name`
  and `$host.Version` properties so that script authors have a better idea of
  where their code is being used.

#### Other improvements

- `$env` variables now have IntelliSense complete correctly (#206).
- The debug adapter now does not crash when you attempt to add breakpoints
  for files that have been moved or don't exist (#195).
- Fixed an issue preventing output from being written in the debugger if you
  don't set a breakpoint before running a script.
- Debug adapter now doesn't crash when rendering an object for the
  variables view if ToString throws an exception.

## 0.5.0
### Thursday, March 10, 2016

#### Support for PowerShell v3 and v4

- Support for PowerShell v3 and v4 is now complete!  Note that for this release,
  Script Analyzer support has been disabled for PS v3 and v4 until we implement
  a better strategy for integrating it as a module dependency

#### Debugging improvements

- Added support for command breakpoints
- Added support for conditional breakpoints
- Improved the debug adapter startup sequence to handle new VS Code debugging features

#### Other improvements

- `using 'module'` now resolves relative paths correctly, removing a syntax error that
  previously appeared when relative paths were used
- Calling `Read-Host -AsSecureString` or `Get-Credential` from the console now shows an
  appropriate "not supported" error message instead of crashing the language service.
  Support for these commands will be added in a later release.

## 0.4.3
### Monday, February 29, 2016

## 0.4.0
### Monday, February 8, 2016

#### Debugging improvements

- A new `Microsoft.PowerShell.EditorServices.Host.x86.exe` executable has been added to enable 32-bit PowerShell sessions on 64-bit machines (thanks [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- You can now pass arguments to scripts in the debugger with the `LaunchRequest.Args` parameter (thanks [@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill)!)
- You can also set the working directory where the script is run by setting the `LaunchRequest.Cwd` parameter to an absolute path (thanks [@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill)!)

#### Console improvements

- Improved PowerShell console output formatting and performance
  - The console prompt is now displayed after a command is executed
  - Command execution errors are now displayed correctly in more cases
  - Console output now wraps at 120 characters instead of 80 characters
  - Console output is now buffered to reduce the number of OutputEvent messages sent from the host to the editor

- Added choice and input prompt support.  Prompts can be shown either through the console or natively
  in the editor via the `powerShell/showInputPrompt` and `powerShell/showChoicePrompt` requests.

#### New host command line parameters

- `/logLevel:<level>`: Sets the log output level for the host.  Possible values: `Verbose`, `Normal`, `Warning`, or `Error`.
- `/logPath:<path>`: Sets the output path for logs written while the host is running

#### Other improvements

- Initial work has been done to ensure support for PowerShell v3 and v4 APIs by compiling against the PowerShell
  reference assemblies that are published on NuGet. (thanks [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- Initial WebSocket channel support (thanks [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- Removed Nito.AsyncEx dependency
