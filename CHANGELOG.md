## v3.8.0
### Thursday, February 02, 2023

In the PR below we rewrote all the symbol logic. Classes (and their properties and
methods) are now proper symbols. Instead of a dozen similar-yet-different Abstract Symbol
Tree (AST) PowerShell script visitors handling different parts of each symbol-related
request, we have a single visitor that builds a cached dictionary of symbols for each
file. This was a massive simplification of the code that also leads to huge performance
improvements across all the symbol related features:

- [Go to Symbol in Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_open-symbol-by-name)
- [Go to Symbol in Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-symbol)
- [Go to Definition](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-definition)
- [Go to References / CodeLens](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_reference-information)
- [Outline view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_outline-view)

Please try it out and give us feedback! There's plenty of room for more improvement, and
this will be much easier going forward.

## v3.0.0
### Thursday, October 28, 2021

This preview release includes a complete overhaul of the core PowerShell engine
of PowerShell Editor Services.
This represents over a year's work,
tracked in [PSES #1295](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/1295)
and implemented in [PSES #1459](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/1459),
and is our answer to many, many issues
opened by users over the last few years.
We're hoping you'll see a marked improvement
in the reliability, performance and footprint
of the extension as a result.

Previously the Integrated Console was run
by setting threadpool tasks on a shared main runspace,
and where LSP servicing was done with PowerShell idle events.
This lead to overhead, threading issues
and a complex implementation intended to work around
the asymmetry between PowerShell as a synchronous,
single-threaded runtime and a language server
as an asynchronous, multi-threaded service.

Now, PowerShell Editor Services maintains its own dedicated pipeline thread,
which is able to service requests similar to JavaScript's event loop,
meaning we can run everything synchronously on the correct thread.
We also get more efficiency because we can directly call
PowerShell APIs and code written in C# from this thread,
without the overhead of a PowerShell pipeline.

This change has overhauled how we service LSP requests,
how the Integrated Console works,
how PSReadLine is integrated,
how debugging is implemented,
how remoting is handled,
and a long tail of other features in PowerShell Editor Services.

Also, in making it, while 6,000 lines of code were added,
we removed 12,000,
for a more maintainable, more efficient
and easier to understand extension backend.

While most of our testing has been re-enabled
(and we're working on adding more),
there are bound to be issues with this new implementation.
Please give this a try and let us know if you run into anything.

We also want to thank [@SeeminglyScience](https://github.com/SeeminglyScience)
for his help and knowledge as we've made this migration.

Finally, a crude breakdown of the work from the commits:

- An initial dedicated pipeline thread consumer implementation
- Implement the console REPL
- Implement PSRL idle handling
- Implement completions
- Move to invoking PSRL as a C# delegate
- Implement cancellation and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
- Make <kbd>F8</kbd> work again
- Ensure execution policy is set correctly
- Implement $PROFILE support
- Make nested prompts work
- Implement REPL debugging
- Implement remote debugging in the REPL
- Hook up the debugging UI
- Implement a new concurrent priority queue for PowerShell tasks
- Reimplement the REPL synchronously rather than on its own thread
- Really get debugging working...
- Implement DSC breakpoint support
- Reimplement legacy readline support
- Ensure stdio is still supported as an LSP transport
- Remove PowerShellContextService and other defunct code
- Get integration tests working again (and improve diagnosis of PSES failures)
- Get unit testing working again (except debug service tests)

## v2.0.0-preview.6
### Friday, November 1, 2019

#### Special Note
In this release of the preview extension,
we've merged significant architectural work into PowerShell Editor Services.
After several months of work, PSES now uses the Omnisharp LSP library
to handle Language Server Protocol interaction instead of rolling its own,
allowing PSES to concentrate on being a good PowerShell backend.
We hope you'll see increased performance and stability in this release.
As always, [please let us know if you find any issues](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/new).

## v2.0.0-preview.1
### Wednesday, January 23, 2019

#### Preview builds of PowerShell Editor Services are now available

#### What the first preview contains

The v2.0.0-preview.1 version of the extension is built on .NET Standard (enabling support for both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core from one assembly)

It also contains PSReadLine support in the integrated console for Windows behind a feature flag. PSReadLine provides a consistent and rich interactive experience, including syntax coloring and multi-line editing and history, in the PowerShell console, in Cloud Shell, and now in VSCode terminal. For more information on the benefits of PSReadLine, check out their [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/about/about_psreadline?view=powershell-6).

To enable PSReadLine support in the Preview version on Windows, please add the following flag to your `Start-EditorServices.ps1` call:

```
-FeatureFlags @('PSReadLine')
```

HUGE thanks to @SeeminglyScience for all his amazing work getting PSReadLine working in PowerShell Editor Services!

#### Breaking Changes

Due to the above changes, this version of the PowerShell Editor Services only works with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 6.

## 1.3.0
### Friday, June 9, 2017

#### Notice of new internal redesign ([#484](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/484), [#488](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/488), [#489](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/489))

This release marks the start of a major redesign of the core PowerShell
Editor Services APIs, PSHost implementation, and service model.  Most of
these changes will be transparent to the language and debugging services
so there shouldn't be any major breaking changes.

The goal is to quickly design and validate a new extensibility model that
allows IFeatureProvider implementations to extend focused feature components
which could be a part of PowerShell Editor Services or another extension
module.  As we progress, certain features may move out of the core Editor
Services module into satellite modules.  This will allow our functionality
to be much more flexible and provide extensions with the same set of
capabilities that built-in features have.

We are moving toward a 2.0 release of the core PowerShell Editor Services
APIs over the next few months once this new design has been validated and
stabilized.  We'll produce updated API documentation as we move closer
to 2.0.

#### New document symbol and CodeLens features ([#490](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/490), [#497](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/497), [#498](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/498))

As part of our new extensibility model work, we've added two new components
which follow the new "feature and provider" model which we'll be moving
all other features to soon.

The IDocumentSymbols feature component provides a list of symbols for a
given document.  It relies on the results provided by a collection of
IDocumentSymbolProvider implementations which can come from any module.
We've added the following built-in IDocumentSymbolProvider implementations:

- ScriptDocumentSymbolProvider: Provides symbols for function and command
  definitions in .ps1 and .psm1 files
- PsdDocumentSymbolProvider: Provides symbols for keys in .psd1 files
- PesterDocumentSymbolProvider: Provides symbols for Describe, Context, and
  It blocks in Pester test scripts

We took a similar approach to developing an ICodeLenses feature component
which retrieves a list of CodeLenses which get displayed in files to provide
visible actions embedded into the code.  We used this design to add the
following built-in ICodeLensProvider implementations:

- ReferencesCodeLensProvider: Shows CodeLenses like "3 references" to indicate
  the number of references to a given function or command
- PesterCodeLensProvider: Shows "Run tests" and "Debug tests" CodeLenses on
  Pester Describe blocks in test script files allowing the user to easily
  run and debug those tests

Note that the ICodeLensProvider and IDocumentSymbolProvider interfaces are
not fully stable yet but we encourage you to try using them so that you can
give us your feedback!

#### Added a new PowerShellEditorServices.Commands module (#[487](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/487), #[496](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/496))

We've added a new Commands module that gets loaded inside of PowerShell Editor
Services to provide useful functionality when the $psEditor API is available.

Thanks to our new co-maintainer [Patrick Meinecke](https://github.com/SeeminglyScience),
we've gained a new set of useful commands for interacting with the $psEditor APIs
within the Integrated Console:

- [Find-Ast](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Find-Ast.md)
- [Get-Token](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Get-Token.md)
- [ConvertFrom-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/ConvertFrom-ScriptExtent.md)
- [ConvertTo-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/ConvertTo-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Set-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Set-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Join-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Join-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Test-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Test-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Import-EditorCommand](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/main/module/docs/Import-EditorCommand.md)

#### Microsoft.PowerShell.EditorServices API removals ([#492](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/492))

We've removed the following classes and interfaces which were previously
considered public APIs in the core Editor Services assembly:

- ConsoleService and IConsoleHost: We now centralize our host interface
  implementations under the standard PSHostUserInterface design.
- IPromptHandlerContext: We no longer have the concept of "prompt handler
  contexts."  Each PSHostUserInterface implementation now has one way of
  displaying console-based prompts to the user.  New editor window prompting
  APIs will be added for the times when a UI is needed.
- Logger: now replaced by a new non-static ILogger instance which can be
  requested by extensions through the IComponentRegistry.

#### Introducing support for Linux and macOS!

This release marks the beginning of our support for Linux and macOS via
the new [cross-platform release of PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

NuGet packages will be provided in the upcoming 0.7.1 release.

#### Other improvements

- Introduced a new TCP channel to provide a commonly-available communication channel
  across multiple editors and platforms
- PowerShell Script Analyzer integration has been shifted from direct use via DLL to
  consuming the PowerShell module and cmdlets
- Updated code to account for platform differences across Windows and Linux/macOS
- Improved stability of the language service when being used in Sublime Text

## 0.6.2
### Tuesday, August 9, 2016

- Fixed #264: Variable and parameter IntelliSense broken in VS Code 1.4.0
- Fixed #240: Completion item with regex metachars can cause editor host to crash
- Fixed #232: Language server sometimes crashes then $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

## 0.6.1
### Monday, May 16, 2016

- Fixed #221: Language server sometimes fails to initialize preventing IntelliSense, etc from working
- Fixed #222: Editor commands are not receiving $host.UI prompt results

## 0.6.0
### Thursday, May 12, 2016

#### Introduced a new documentation site

- We have launched a new [documentation site](https://powershell.github.io/PowerShellEditorServices/)
  for this project on GitHub Pages.  This documentation provides both a user guide
  and .NET API documentation pages that are generated directly from our code
  documentation.  Check it out and let us know what you think!

#### Added a new cross-editor extensibility model

- We've added a new extensibility model which allows you to write PowerShell
  code to add new functionality to Visual Studio Code and other editors with
  a single API.  If you've used `$psISE` in the PowerShell ISE, you'll feel
  right at home with `$psEditor`.  Check out the [documentation](https://powershell.github.io/PowerShellEditorServices/guide/extensions.html)
  for more details!

#### Support for user and system-wide profiles

- We've now introduced the `$profile` variable which contains the expected
  properties that you normally see in `powershell.exe` and `powershell_ise.exe`:
  - `AllUsersAllHosts`
  - `AllUsersCurrentHost`
  - `CurrentUserAllHosts`
  - `CurrentUserCurrentHost`
- Each editor integration can specify what their host-specific profile filename
  should be.  If no profile name has been specified a default of `PowerShellEditorServices_profile.ps1`
  is used.
- Profiles are not loaded by default when PowerShell Editor Services is used.
  This behavior may change in the future based on user feedback.
- Editor integrations can also specify their name and version for the `$host.Name`
  and `$host.Version` properties so that script authors have a better idea of
  where their code is being used.

#### Other improvements

- `$env` variables now have IntelliSense complete correctly (#206).
- The debug adapter now does not crash when you attempt to add breakpoints
  for files that have been moved or don't exist (#195).
- Fixed an issue preventing output from being written in the debugger if you
  don't set a breakpoint before running a script.
- Debug adapter now doesn't crash when rendering an object for the
  variables view if ToString throws an exception.

## 0.5.0
### Thursday, March 10, 2016

#### Support for PowerShell v3 and v4

- Support for PowerShell v3 and v4 is now complete!  Note that for this release,
  Script Analyzer support has been disabled for PS v3 and v4 until we implement
  a better strategy for integrating it as a module dependency

#### Debugging improvements

- Added support for command breakpoints
- Added support for conditional breakpoints
- Improved the debug adapter startup sequence to handle new VS Code debugging features

#### Other improvements

- `using 'module'` now resolves relative paths correctly, removing a syntax error that
  previously appeared when relative paths were used
- Calling `Read-Host -AsSecureString` or `Get-Credential` from the console now shows an
  appropriate "not supported" error message instead of crashing the language service.
  Support for these commands will be added in a later release.

- A new `Microsoft.PowerShell.EditorServices.Host.x86.exe` executable has been added to enable 32-bit PowerShell sessions on 64-bit machines (thanks [@adamdriscoll](https://github.com/adamdriscoll)!)
- You can now pass arguments to scripts in the debugger with the `LaunchRequest.Args` parameter (thanks [@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill)!)
- You can also set the working directory where the script is run by setting the `LaunchRequest.Cwd` parameter to an absolute path (thanks [@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill)!)

#### Console improvements

- Improved PowerShell console output formatting and performance
  - The console prompt is now displayed after a command is executed
  - Command execution errors are now displayed correctly in more cases
  - Console output now wraps at 120 characters instead of 80 characters
  - Console output is now buffered to reduce the number of OutputEvent messages sent from the host to the editor

- Added choice and input prompt support.  Prompts can be shown either through the console or natively
  in the editor via the `powerShell/showInputPrompt` and `powerShell/showChoicePrompt` requests.

#### New host command line parameters

- `/logLevel:<level>`: Sets the log output level for the host.  Possible values: `Verbose`, `Normal`, `Warning`, or `Error`.
- `/logPath:<path>`: Sets the output path for logs written while the host is running

#### Other improvements
