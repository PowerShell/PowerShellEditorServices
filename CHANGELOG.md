## v2.0.0-preview.1
### Wednesday, January 23, 2019

#### Preview builds of PowerShell Editor Services are now available

#### What the first preview contains

The v2.0.0-preview.1 version of the extension is built on .NET Standard (enabling support for both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core from one assembly)

It also contains PSReadLine support in the integrated console for Windows behind a feature flag. PSReadLine provides a consistent and rich interactive experience, including syntax coloring and multi-line editing and history, in the PowerShell console, in Cloud Shell, and now in VSCode terminal. For more information on the benefits of PSReadLine, check out their [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/about/about_psreadline?view=powershell-6).

To enable PSReadLine support in the Preview version on Windows, please add the following flag to your `Start-EditorServices.ps1` call:

```
-FeatureFlags @('PSReadLine')
```

HUGE thanks to @SeeminglyScience for all his amazing work getting PSReadLine working in PowerShell Editor Services!

#### Breaking Changes

Due to the above changes, this version of the PowerShell Editor Services only works with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 6.

## 1.3.0
### Friday, June 9, 2017

#### Notice of new internal redesign ([#484](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/484), [#488](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/488), [#489](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/489))

This release marks the start of a major redesign of the core PowerShell
Editor Services APIs, PSHost implementation, and service model.  Most of
these changes will be transparent to the language and debugging services
so there shouldn't be any major breaking changes.

The goal is to quickly design and validate a new extensibility model that
allows IFeatureProvider implementations to extend focused feature components
which could be a part of PowerShell Editor Services or another extension
module.  As we progress, certain features may move out of the core Editor
Services module into satellite modules.  This will allow our functionality
to be much more flexible and provide extensions with the same set of
capabilities that built-in features have.

We are moving toward a 2.0 release of the core PowerShell Editor Services
APIs over the next few months once this new design has been validated and
stabilized.  We'll produce updated API documentation as we move closer
to 2.0.

#### New document symbol and CodeLens features ([#490](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/490), [#497](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/497), [#498](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/498))

As part of our new extensibility model work, we've added two new components
which follow the new "feature and provider" model which we'll be moving
all other features to soon.

The IDocumentSymbols feature component provides a list of symbols for a
given document.  It relies on the results provided by a collection of
IDocumentSymbolProvider implementations which can come from any module.
We've added the following built-in IDocumentSymbolProvider implementations:

- ScriptDocumentSymbolProvider: Provides symbols for function and command
  definitions in .ps1 and .psm1 files
- PsdDocumentSymbolProvider: Provides symbols for keys in .psd1 files
- PesterDocumentSymbolProvider: Provides symbols for Describe, Context, and
  It blocks in Pester test scripts

We took a similar approach to developing an ICodeLenses feature component
which retrieves a list of CodeLenses which get displayed in files to provide
visible actions embedded into the code.  We used this design to add the
following built-in ICodeLensProvider implementations:

- ReferencesCodeLensProvider: Shows CodeLenses like "3 references" to indicate
  the number of references to a given function or command
- PesterCodeLensProvider: Shows "Run tests" and "Debug tests" CodeLenses on
  Pester Describe blocks in test script files allowing the user to easily
  run and debug those tests

Note that the ICodeLensProvider and IDocumentSymbolProvider interfaces are
not fully stable yet but we encourage you to try using them so that you can
give us your feedback!

#### Added a new PowerShellEditorServices.Commands module (#[487](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/487), #[496](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/496))

We've added a new Commands module that gets loaded inside of PowerShell Editor
Services to provide useful functionality when the $psEditor API is available.

Thanks to our new co-maintainer [Patrick Meinecke](https://github.com/SeeminglyScience),
we've gained a new set of useful commands for interacting with the $psEditor APIs
within the Integrated Console:

- [Find-Ast](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/master/module/docs/Find-Ast.md)
- [Get-Token](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/master/module/docs/Get-Token.md)
- [ConvertFrom-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/master/module/docs/ConvertFrom-ScriptExtent.md)
- [ConvertTo-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/master/module/docs/ConvertTo-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Set-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/master/module/docs/Set-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Join-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/master/module/docs/Join-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Test-ScriptExtent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/master/module/docs/Test-ScriptExtent.md)
- [Import-EditorCommand](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/master/module/docs/Import-EditorCommand.md)

#### Microsoft.PowerShell.EditorServices API removals ([#492](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/492))

We've removed the following classes and interfaces which were previously
considered public APIs in the core Editor Services assembly:

- ConsoleService and IConsoleHost: We now centralize our host interface
  implementations under the standard PSHostUserInterface design.
- IPromptHandlerContext: We no longer have the concept of "prompt handler
  contexts."  Each PSHostUserInterface implementation now has one way of
  displaying console-based prompts to the user.  New editor window prompting
  APIs will be added for the times when a UI is needed.
- Logger: now replaced by a new non-static ILogger instance which can be
  requested by extensions through the IComponentRegistry.

### Tuesday, April 4, 2017

#### Fixes and improvements

- Added [#408](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/408) -
  Enabled debugging of untitled script files

  Script column number is now reported in the top stack frame when the debugger
  stops to aid in displaying a column indicator in Visual Studio Code

- Fixed [#411](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/411) -
  Commands executed internally now interrupt the integrated console's command
  prompt

- Fixed [#409](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/pull/409) -
  PowerShell session now does not crash when a breakpoint is hit outside of
  debug mode

- Fixed [#614](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/614) -
  Auto variables are now populating correctly in the debugger.  **NOTE**: There is
  a known issue where all of a script's variables begin to show up in the
  Auto list after running a script for the first time.  This is caused by
  a change in 0.11.0 where we now dot-source all debugged scripts.  We will
  provide an option for this behavior in the future

#### Introducing support for Linux and macOS!

This release marks the beginning of our support for Linux and macOS via
the new [cross-platform release of PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

NuGet packages will be provided in the upcoming 0.7.1 release.

#### Other improvements

  across multiple editors and platforms

### Monday, May 16, 2016

- Fixed #221: Language server sometimes fails to initialize preventing IntelliSense, etc from working
- Fixed #222: Editor commands are not receiving $host.UI prompt results

## 0.6.0
### Thursday, May 12, 2016

#### Introduced a new documentation site

- We have launched a new [documentation site](https://powershell.github.io/PowerShellEditorServices/)
  for this project on GitHub Pages.  This documentation provides both a user guide
  and .NET API documentation pages that are generated directly from our code
  documentation.  Check it out and let us know what you think!

#### Added a new cross-editor extensibility model

- We've added a new extensibility model which allows you to write PowerShell
  code to add new functionality to Visual Studio Code and other editors with
  a single API.  If you've used `$psISE` in the PowerShell ISE, you'll feel
  right at home with `$psEditor`.  Check out the [documentation](https://powershell.github.io/PowerShellEditorServices/guide/extensions.html)
  for more details!

#### Support for user and system-wide profiles

- We've now introduced the `$profile` variable which contains the expected
  properties that you normally see in `powershell.exe` and `powershell_ise.exe`:
  - `AllUsersAllHosts`
  - `AllUsersCurrentHost`
  - `CurrentUserAllHosts`
  - `CurrentUserCurrentHost`
- Each editor integration can specify what their host-specific profile filename
  should be.  If no profile name has been specified a default of `PowerShellEditorServices_profile.ps1`
  is used.
- Profiles are not loaded by default when PowerShell Editor Services is used.
  This behavior may change in the future based on user feedback.
- Editor integrations can also specify their name and version for the `$host.Name`
  and `$host.Version` properties so that script authors have a better idea of
  where their code is being used.

#### Other improvements

- `$env` variables now have IntelliSense complete correctly (#206).
- The debug adapter now does not crash when you attempt to add breakpoints
  for files that have been moved or don't exist (#195).
- Fixed an issue preventing output from being written in the debugger if you
  don't set a breakpoint before running a script.
- Debug adapter now doesn't crash when rendering an object for the
  variables view if ToString throws an exception.

## 0.5.0
### Thursday, March 10, 2016

#### Support for PowerShell v3 and v4

- Support for PowerShell v3 and v4 is now complete!  Note that for this release,
  Script Analyzer support has been disabled for PS v3 and v4 until we implement
  a better strategy for integrating it as a module dependency

#### Debugging improvements

- Added support for command breakpoints
- Added support for conditional breakpoints
- Improved the debug adapter startup sequence to handle new VS Code debugging features

#### Other improvements

- `using 'module'` now resolves relative paths correctly, removing a syntax error that
  previously appeared when relative paths were used
- Calling `Read-Host -AsSecureString` or `Get-Credential` from the console now shows an
  appropriate "not supported" error message instead of crashing the language service.
  Support for these commands will be added in a later release.

- You can now pass arguments to scripts in the debugger with the `LaunchRequest.Args` parameter (thanks [@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill)!)
- You can also set the working directory where the script is run by setting the `LaunchRequest.Cwd` parameter to an absolute path (thanks [@rkeithhill](https://github.com/rkeithhill)!)

  - The console prompt is now displayed after a command is executed
  - Command execution errors are now displayed correctly in more cases
  - Console output now wraps at 120 characters instead of 80 characters
  - Console output is now buffered to reduce the number of OutputEvent messages sent from the host to the editor

- Added choice and input prompt support.  Prompts can be shown either through the console or natively
  in the editor via the `powerShell/showInputPrompt` and `powerShell/showChoicePrompt` requests.
