# Using the PowerShell Editor Services Host Process

The PowerShell Editor Services host process provides an editor-agnostic interface for
leveraging the core .NET API.

**WARNING: Some of the information in this file is out of date due to recent protocol
changes.  The general details in the document still apply but the schema of the language service
message has changed a lot.  This document will be updated soon with the correct details.**

## Launching the Host Process

From your editor's PowerShell plugin code, launch `Microsoft.PowerShell.EditorServices.Host.exe` 
using an editor-native process API that allows you to read and write this process' standard in/out 
streams.  All communication with the host process occurs via this channel.

It is recommended that the process I/O be dealt with as a byte stream rather than read as a 
string since different parts of the message format could be sent with different text encodings 
(see next section).

It is expected that an editor will launch one instance of the host process for each PowerShell
'workspace' that the user has opened.  Generally this would map to a single top-level folder
which contains all of the user's PowerShell script files for a given project.

# Message Protocol

A message consists of two parts: a header section and the message body.  For now, there is
only one header, `Content-Length`.  This header, written with ASCII encoding, specifies the 
UTF-8 byte length of the message content to follow.  The host process expects that all messages
sent to it will come with an accurate `Content-Length` header so that it knows exactly how many
bytes to read.  Likewise, all messages returned from the host process will be sent in this manner.

## Message Schema

The body of a message is encoded in JSON and conforms to a specific schema.  There are three types of
messages that can be transmitted between editor and host process: `Request`, `Response`, and `Event`.

### Common Fields

The common fields shared between all message types are as follows:

- `seq`: A sequence number that increases with each message sent from the editor to the host.
  Even though this field shows up on all message types, it is generally only used to correlate
  reponse messages to the initial request that caused it.
- `type`: The type of message being transmitted, either `request`, `response`, or `event`.

### Request Fields

A request gets sent by the editor when a particular type of behavior is needed.
In this case, the `type` field will be set to `request`.

- `command`: The request type.  There are a variety of request types that will be enumerated
  later in this document.
- `arguments`: A JSON object containing arguments for the request, varies per each request `command`.

*NOTE: Some `request` types do not require a matching `response` or may cause `events` to be raised at a later time*

### Response Fields

A response gets sent by the host process when a request completes or fails.  In this case,
the `type`field will be set to `response`.

- `request_seq`: The `seq` number that was included with the original request, used to help 
  the editor correlate the response to the original request
- `command`: The name of the request command to which this response relates
- `body`: A JSON object body for the response, varies per each response `command`.
- `success`: A boolean indicating whether the request was successful
- `message`: An optional response message, generally used when `success` is set to `false`.

### Event Fields

An event gets sent by the host process when 

- `event`: The name of the event type to which this event relates
- `body`: A JSON object body for the event, varies per each `event` type

# Request and Response Types

## File Management

### `open`

This request is sent by the editor when the user opens a file with a known PowerShell extension.  It causes
the file to be opened by the language service and parsed for syntax errors.

#### Request

The arguments object specifies the absolute file path to be loaded.

```json
    {
      "seq": 0,
      "type": "request",
      "command": "open",
      "arguments": {
        "file": "c:/Users/daviwil/.vscode/extensions/vscode-powershell/examples/Stop-Process2.ps1"
      }
    }
```

#### Response

No response is needed for this command.

### `close`

This request is sent by the editor when the user closes a file with a known PowerShell extension which was
previously opened in the language service.

#### Request

The arguments object specifies the absolute file path to be closed.

```json
    {
      "seq": 3,
      "type": "request",
      "command": "close",
      "arguments": {
        "file": "c:/Users/daviwil/.vscode/extensions/vscode-powershell/examples/Stop-Process2.ps1"
      }
    }
```

#### Response

No response is needed for this command.

### `change`

This request is sent by the editor when the user changes the contents of a PowerShell file that has previously
been opened in the language service.  Depending on how the request arguments are specified, the file change could 
either be an arbitrary-length string insertion, region delete, or region replacement.  

It is up to the editor to decide how often to send these requests in response
to the user's typing activity.  The language service can deal with change deltas of any length, so it is really
just a matter of preference how often `change` requests are sent.  

#### Request

The arguments for this request specify the absolute path of the `file` being changed as well as the complete details
of the edit that the user performed.  The `line`/`endLine` and `offset`/`endOffset` (column) numbers indicate the
1-based range of the file that is being replaced.  The `insertString` field indicates the string that will be 
inserted.  In the specified range. 

*NOTE: In the very near future, all file locations will be specified with zero-based coordinates.*

```json
    {
      "seq": 9,
      "type": "request",
      "command": "change",
      "arguments": {
        "file": "c:/Users/daviwil/.vscode/extensions/vscode-powershell/examples/Stop-Process2.ps1",
        "line": 39,
        "offset": 5,
        "endLine": 39,
        "endOffset": 5,
        "insertString": "Test\r\nchange"
      }
    }
```

#### Response

No response is needed for this command.

### `geterr`

This request causes script diagnostics to be performed on a list of script file paths.  The editor
will typically send this request after every successful `change` request (though it is best to throttle
these requests on the editor side so that it doesn't overwhelm the host).  Responses will be sent back
as `syntaxDiag` and `semanticDiag` events.

#### Request

The arguments for this request specify the list of `files` to be analyzed (sorted by those most recently changed)
and a millisecond `delay` value which instructs the language service to wait for some period before performing
diagnostics.  If another `geterr` request is sent before the specified `delay` expires, the original request will
be cancelled server-side and a new delay period will start.

```json
    {
      "seq": 1,
      "type": "request",
      "command": "geterr",
      "arguments": {
        "delay": 750,
        "files": [
          "c:/Users/daviwil/.vscode/extensions/vscode-powershell/examples/Stop-Process2.ps1"

## Debugger Operations

### `initialize`

### `launch`

This request is sent by the editor when the user wants to launch a given script file in the
debugger.

#### Request

```json
    {
      "type": "request",
      "seq": 3,
      "command": "launch",
      "arguments": {

      "body": null,
      "seq": 0,
      "type": "response"
    }
```

### `disconnect`

This request is sent by the editor when the user wants to terminate the debugging session before 
the script completes.  When this message is received, execution of the script is aborted and the
instance of the host process is aborted.

*NOTE: For now, it is assumed that debugging will be performed in a separate instance of the
 host process.  This will change in the next couple of minor releases.*

## Language Service Events

### `started`

This message is sent as soon as the language service finishes initializing.  The editor will
wait for this message to be received before it starts sending requests to the host.  This event
has no body and will always be `null`.

```json
    {
      "event": "started",
      "body": null,
      "seq": 0,
      "type": "event"
    }
```

## Debugger Events

### `initialized`

```json
    {
      "event": "initialized",
      "body": null,
      "seq": 0,
      "type": "event"
    }
```

### `stopped`

```json
    {
      "event": "stopped",
