# Register-EditorCommand

## SYNOPSIS

Registers a command which can be executed in the host editor.

## SYNTAX

### Function

```powershell
Register-EditorCommand -Name <String> -DisplayName <String> -Function <String> [-SuppressOutput]
```

### ScriptBlock

```powershell
Register-EditorCommand -Name <String> -DisplayName <String> -ScriptBlock <ScriptBlock> [-SuppressOutput]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Registers a command which can be executed in the host editor. This
command will be shown to the user either in a menu or command palette.
Upon invoking this command, either a function/cmdlet or ScriptBlock will
be executed depending on whether the -Function or -ScriptBlock parameter
was used when the command was registered.

This command can be run multiple times for the same command so that its
details can be updated. However, re-registration of commands should only
be used for development purposes, not for dynamic behavior.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------

```powershell
Register-EditorCommand -Name "MyModule.MyFunctionCommand" -DisplayName "My function command" -Function Invoke-MyCommand -SuppressOutput
```

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------

```powershell
Register-EditorCommand -Name "MyModule.MyScriptBlockCommand" -DisplayName "My ScriptBlock command" -ScriptBlock { Write-Output "Hello from my command!" }
```
