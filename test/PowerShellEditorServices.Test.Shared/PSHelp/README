Windows PowerShell does not have updated help in CI by default and we utilize a private Azure Devops repo for builds that has no internet access. The completion tests validate the Windows Help so we update it offline from here so these tests can work. The help is updated as part of the build pipeline in PowerShellEditorServices.build.ps1 for PS5 only.
